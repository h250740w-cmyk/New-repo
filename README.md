#Description

This project is a basic Python script that simulates a simple login system. It prompts the user to enter a username and password, then checks the credentials against predefined values.

#Features

- Prompts user for a username and password
- Validates credentials against hardcoded values
- Displays access status based on input

#How It Works

1. The script asks the user to input a username and password.
2. It checks if the username is `"admin"` and the password is `"1234"`.
3. If both match, it prints `"Access Granted"`.
4. Otherwise, it prints `"Access Denied"`.
